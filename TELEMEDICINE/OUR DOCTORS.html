        <h1><u>DOCTORS AVAILABLE HERE</u></h1>
    <p>There are many types of doctors, but there are two main categories: primary care or specialty care</p>
    <p>Each type of doctor undergoes their own unique training and education to allow them to diagnose and treat specific diseases and conditions.

        Because there are so many types of doctors, most people see a primary care physician for health problems first. This doctor may then refer or recommend the person to see a specialist when they need one.</p>
